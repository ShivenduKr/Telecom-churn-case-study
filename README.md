# Telecom-churn-case-study
## Problem Statement:
Customers in the telecom sector have access to a variety of service providers and can actively switch from one operator to another. The telecoms business has an average annual churn rate of 15 to 25 percent in this fiercely competitive market. Customer retention has now surpassed customer acquisition in importance due to the fact that it is 5â€“10 times more expensive to gain new customers than to keep existing ones.
Retaining highly profitable consumers is the top business objective for many established operators.

Telecom businesses must identify the consumers who are most likely to leave in order to reduce customer turnover.

In this project, we'll analyze customer-level data from a top telecom company, create predictive models to find customers who are most likely to leave, and pinpoint the key signs of churn.
